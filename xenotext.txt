any style of life
is prim
oh stay
my lyre
with wily ploys
moan the riff
the riff
of any tune aloud
moan now my fate
in fate
we rely
my myth
now is the word
the word of life
the faery is rosy
of glow
in fate
we rely
moan more grief
with any loss
any loss
is the achy trick
with him we stay
oh stay
my lyre
we wean
him of any milk
any milk is rosy
